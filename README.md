## Arduino Autopilot
#### By Cameron Swinoga

Code for Arduino pro mini to recieve CPPM signals from a RC reciever and send the data over serial. The serial data is revcieved by an Arduino nano and then can be sent to servos for a passthrough system, or totally autonomous autopilot. Tested live on a real plane for input lag and stability.
